# Cracking the Coding Interview

`Your best and wisest refuge from all troubles is in your science.`

_Ada Lovelace_

This will be my attempt to really grasp into the basis and fundamentals of CS, studying by myself the contents of this book. 

If I can acomplish this, then I can work remote as a developer somewhere in the near future.

I feel a bit frightened but I've a good understanding of Java - Python - Dart - JS and other programming languages, not so with some CS concepts. I'll do my best to learn in a self paced way.

I need to learn about:

- Big O notation
- Data Structures 
- Algorithm Design & Approaches
- Sorting & searching
- And more... (I'll add more topics as i go)

As -Shia LaBeouf_ once said :

`JUST DO IT!`

Day 1: Start the journey
Day 2: Reading about Big O.
Day 3: Chapter IX, interview questions.
